    <p>We recognize that you need stability from the Angular framework.
Stability ensures that reusable components and libraries, tutorials, tools, and learned practices don't become obsolete unexpectedly.
Stability is essential for the ecosystem around Angular to thrive.</p>
<p>We also share with you the need for Angular to keep evolving.
We strive to ensure that the foundation on top of which you are building is continuously improving and enabling you to stay up-to-date with the rest of the web ecosystem and your user needs.</p>
<p>This document contains the practices that we follow to provide you with a leading-edge application development platform, balanced with stability.
We strive to ensure that future changes are always introduced in a predictable way.
We want everyone who depends on Angular to know when and how new features are added, and to be well-prepared when obsolete ones are removed.</p>
<p>Sometimes <em>breaking changes</em>, such as the removal of APIs or features, are necessary to innovate and stay current with evolving best practices, changing dependencies, or shifts in the web platform. These breaking changes go through a deprecation process explained in our <a href="#deprecation-policy">deprecation policy</a>.</p>
<p>To make these transitions as straightforward as possible, the Angular team makes these commitments:</p>

  <ul class="docs-list">
    <li>We work hard to minimize the number of breaking changes and to provide migration tools when possible</li>
<li>We follow the deprecation policy described here, so you have time to update your applications to the latest APIs and best practices</li>

  </ul>
  
    <div class="docs-alert docs-alert-helpful">
    <p><strong>HELPFUL:</strong> The practices described in this document apply to Angular 2.0 and later.
If you are currently using AngularJS, see <a href="https://angular.io/guide/upgrade" title="Upgrading from Angular JS" target="_blank">Upgrading from AngularJS</a>.
<em>AngularJS</em> is the name for all v1.x versions of Angular.</p>

  <p>Angular version numbers indicate the level of changes that are introduced by the release.
This use of <a href="https://semver.org/" title="Semantic Versioning Specification" target="_blank">semantic versioning</a> helps you understand the potential impact of updating to a new version.</p>
<p>Angular version numbers have three parts: <code>major.minor.patch</code>.
For example, version 7.2.11 indicates major version 7, minor version 2, and patch level 11.</p>
<p>The version number is incremented based on the level of change included in the release.</p>

  <p>We work toward a regular schedule of releases, so that you can plan and coordinate your updates with the continuing evolution of Angular.</p>

    <p>In general, expect the following release cycle:</p>

  <ul class="docs-list">
    <li>A major release every 6 months</li>
<li>1-3 minor releases for each major release</li>
<li>A patch release and pre-release (<code>next</code> or <code>rc</code>) build almost every week</li>

  </ul>
  <p>This cadence of releases gives eager developers access to new features as soon as they are fully developed and pass through our code review and integration testing processes, while maintaining the stability and reliability of the platform for production users that prefer to receive features after they have been validated by Google and other developers that use the pre-release builds.</p>

  <p>When the Angular team intends to remove an API or feature, it will be marked as <em>deprecated</em>. This occurs when an API is obsolete, superseded by another API, or otherwise discontinued. Deprecated API remain available through their deprecated phase, which lasts a minimum two major versions (approximately one year).</p>
<p>To help ensure that you have sufficient time and a clear path to update, this is our deprecation policy:</p>

Deprecated APIs appear in the <a href="api?status=deprecated">documentation</a> with <del>strikethrough</del>. When we announce a deprecation, we also announce a recommended update path. Additionally, all deprecated APIs are annotated with <code>@deprecated</code> in the corresponding documentation, which enables text editors and IDEs to provide hints if your project depends on them.</td>

<td align="left">Deprecation period</td>
<td align="left">When an API or a feature is deprecated, it is still present in at least the next two major releases (period of at least 12 months). After that, deprecated APIs and features are candidates for removal. A deprecation can be announced in any release, but the removal of a deprecated API or feature happens only in major release. Until a deprecated API or feature is removed, it is maintained according to the LTS support policy, meaning that only critical and security issues are fixed.</td>

<td align="left">We only make npm dependency updates that require changes to your applications in a major release.

  </h2>
  <p>Angular is a collection of many packages, subprojects, and tools.
To prevent accidental use of private APIs and so that you can clearly understand what is covered by the practices described here — we document what is and is not considered our public API surface.
For details, see <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/public-api-surface.md" title="Supported Public API Surface of Angular" target="_blank">Supported Public API Surface of Angular</a>.</p>
<p>To guarantee backward compatibility of Angular we run a series of checks before we merge any change:</p>

  <ul class="docs-list">
    <li>Unit tests and integration tests</li>
<li>Comparing the type definitions of the public API surface before and after the change</li>
<li>Running the tests of all the applications at Google that depend on Angular</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Any changes to the public API surface are made in accordance with the versioning, support, and depreciation policies previously described. In exceptional cases, such as critical security patches, fixes may introduce backwards incompatible changes. Such exceptional cases are accompanied by explicit notice on the framework's official communication channels.</p>

    <a href="#breaking-change-policy-and-update-paths" class="docs-anchor" tabindex="-1" aria-label="Link to Breaking change policy and update paths">Breaking change policy and update paths</a>
  </h2>
  <p>Breaking change requires you to do work because the state after it is not backward compatible with the state before it. You can find the rare exceptions from this rule in the <a href="#compatibility-policy">Compatibility policy</a>. Examples of breaking changes are the removal of public APIs or other changes of the type definition of Angular, changing the timing of calls, or updating to a new version of a dependency of Angular, which includes breaking changes itself.</p>
<p>To support you in case of breaking changes in Angular:</p>

  <ul class="docs-list">
    <li>We follow our <a href="#deprecation-policy">deprecation policy</a> before we remove a public API</li>
<li>Support update automation via the <code>ng update</code> command. It provides code transformations which we often have tested ahead of time over hundreds of thousands of projects at Google</li>
<li>Step by step instructions how to update from one major version to another at the <a href="update-guide">"Angular Update Guide"</a></li>

  </ul>
  <p>You can <code>ng update</code> to any version of Angular, provided that the following criteria are met:</p>

  <ul class="docs-list">
    <li>The version you want to update <em>to</em> is supported.</li>
<li>The version you want to update <em>from</em> is within one major version of the version you want to
  upgrade to.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>For example, you can update from version 11 to version 12, provided that version 12 is still supported.
If you want to update across multiple major versions, perform each update one major version at a time.
For example, to update from version 10 to version 12:</p>

    <ol class="docs-ordered-list">
      <li>Update from version 10 to version 11.</li>
<li>Update from version 11 to version 12.</li>

  </h2>
  <p>Occasionally we introduce new APIs under the label of "Developer Preview". These are APIs that are fully functional and polished, but that we are not ready to stabilize under our normal deprecation policy.</p>
<p>This may be because we want to gather feedback from real applications before stabilization, or because the associated documentation or migration tooling is not fully complete. Feedback can be provided via a <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a>, where developers can share their experiences, report bugs, or suggest improvements to help refine the feature.</p>
<p>The policies and practices that are described in this document do not apply to APIs marked as Developer Preview. Such APIs can change at any time, even in new patch versions of the framework. Teams should decide for themselves whether the benefits of using Developer Preview APIs are worth the risk of breaking changes outside of our normal use of semantic versioning.</p>

  <p>These APIs might not become stable at all or have significant changes before becoming stable.</p>
<p>The policies and practices that are described in this document do not apply to APIs marked as experimental. Such APIs can change at any time, even in new patch versions of the framework. Teams should decide for themselves whether the benefits of using experimental APIs are worth the risk of breaking changes outside of our normal use of semantic versioning.</p>
