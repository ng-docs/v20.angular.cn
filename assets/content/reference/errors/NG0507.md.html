    <p>Angular throws this error when it detects that the content generated by server-side rendering (SSR) was altered after the rendering. The process of hydration relies on the content to be untouched after SSR, which also includes whitespaces and comment nodes. Those whitespaces and comment nodes must be retained in the HTML generated by the SSR process. Learn more in the Hydration guide.</p>

  <p>Typically this happens in the following cases:</p>
<p>Some CDN providers have a built-in feature to remove whitespaces and comment nodes from HTML as an optimization. Please verify if there is such an option in CDN configuration and turn it off.
If you use custom post-processing of HTML generated by SSR (as a build step), make sure that this process doesn't remove whitespaces and comment nodes.</p>
