    <p>One or more elements cannot be resolved during compilation because the element is not defined by the HTML spec, or there is no component or directive with such element selector.</p>

  <p>Use the element name in the error to find the file(s) where the element is being used.</p>
<p>Check that the name and selector are correct.</p>
<p>Make sure that the component is correctly imported inside your NgModule or standalone component, by checking its presence in the <code>imports</code> field. If the component is declared in an NgModule (meaning that it is not standalone) make sure that it is exported correctly from it, by checking its presence in the <code>exports</code> field.</p>
<p>When using custom elements or web components, ensure that you add <a href="api/core/CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA"><a href="/api/core/CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA"><code>CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</code></a></a> to the application module.</p>
<p>If this does not resolve the error, check the imported libraries for any recent changes to the exports and properties you are using, and restart your server.</p>
