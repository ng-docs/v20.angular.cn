    <p>Required child query (<a href="/api/core/contentChild#required"><code>contentChild.required</code></a> or <a href="/api/core/viewChild#required"><code>viewChild.required</code></a>) result was accessed before query results were calculated or query has no matches.</p>
<p>This can happen in two distinct situations:</p>

  <ul class="docs-list">
    <li>query results were accessed before a given query could collect results;</li>
<li>a query was executed but didn't match any nodes and has no results as a consequence.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Content queries and view queries each calculate their results at different points in time:</p>

  <ul class="docs-list">
    <li><a href="/api/core/contentChild"><code>contentChild</code></a> results are available after a <em>host</em> view (template where a directive declaring a query is used) is created;</li>
<li><a href="/api/core/viewChild"><code>viewChild</code></a> results are available after a template of a component declaring a query is created.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Accessing query results before they're available results in the error described on this page. Most notably, query results are <em>never</em> available in a constructor of the component or directive declaring a query.</p>

  <p><a href="/api/core/contentChild"><code>contentChild</code></a> query results can be accessed in the <a href="/api/core/AfterContentChecked"><code>AfterContentChecked</code></a> lifecycle hook, or later.
<a href="/api/core/viewChild"><code>viewChild</code></a> query results can be accessed in the <a href="/api/core/AfterViewChecked"><code>AfterViewChecked</code></a> lifecycle hook, or later.</p>
<p>Make sure that a required query matches at least one node and has results at all. You can verify this by accessing query results in the lifecycle hooks listed above.</p>
