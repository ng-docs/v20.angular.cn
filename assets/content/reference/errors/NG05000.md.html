    <p>This warning means that the hydration was enabled for an application that was configured to use an unsupported version of Zone.js: either a custom or a "noop" one (see more info <a href="api/core/BootstrapOptions#ngZone">here</a>).</p>
<p>Hydration relies on a signal from Zone.js when it becomes stable inside an application, so that Angular can start the serialization process on the server or post-hydration cleanup on the client (to remove DOM nodes that remained unclaimed).</p>
<p>Providing a custom or a "noop" Zone.js implementation may lead to a different timing of the "stable" event, thus triggering the serialization or the cleanup too early or too late. This is not yet a fully supported configuration.</p>
<p>If you use a custom Zone.js implementation, make sure that the "onStable" event is emitted at the right time and does not result in incorrect application behavior with hydration.</p>
<p>More information about hydration can be found in the <a href="guide/hydration">hydration guide</a>.</p>
