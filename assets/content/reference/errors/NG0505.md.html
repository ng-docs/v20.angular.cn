    <p>This error occurs when hydration is enabled on the client, but the server response
doesn't contain special serialized information about the application that hydration
logic relies on.</p>
<p>This can happen when the <a href="/api/platform-browser/provideClientHydration"><code>provideClientHydration()</code></a> function is included in the client
part of the application configuration, but is missing in the server part of the configuration.</p>
<p>In applications with the default project structure (generated by the <code>ng new</code>),
the <a href="/api/platform-browser/provideClientHydration"><code>provideClientHydration()</code></a> call is added either into the <code>providers</code> array of
the main <code>AppModule</code> (which is imported into the server module) or into a set of
providers that are included into both client and server configurations.</p>
<p>If you have a custom setup where client and server configuration are independent
and do not share common set of providers, make sure that the <a href="/api/platform-browser/provideClientHydration"><code>provideClientHydration()</code></a>
is also included into the set of providers used to bootstrap an application on the server.</p>
<p>More information about hydration can be found in <a href="guide/hydration">this guide</a>.</p>

  <p>Verify that the <a href="/api/platform-browser/provideClientHydration"><code>provideClientHydration()</code></a> call is included into a set of providers
that is used to bootstrap an application on the server.</p>
