    <p>As an open source project, Angular’s daily commits, PRs and momentum is all trackable on GitHub. To increase transparency into how this daily work connects to the framework’s future, our roadmap brings together the team’s current and future planned vision.</p>
<p>The following projects are not associated with a particular Angular version. We will release them on completion, and they will be part of a specific version based on our release schedule, following semantic versioning. For example, we release features in the next minor after completion or the next major if they include breaking changes.</p>
<p>Currently, Angular has two goals for the framework:</p>

    <ol class="docs-ordered-list">
      <li>Improve the <a href="#improving-the-angular-developer-experience">Angular developer experience</a> and</li>
<li>Improve the <a href="#fast-by-default">framework’s performance</a>.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Continue reading to learn how we plan to deliver these objectives with specific project work.</p>

      <h3>Selectorless</h3>
      <p>To reduce boilerplate and improve the ergonomics of standalone components we are now designing a solution that will make selectors optional. To use a component or directive you'll be able to import it and directly use it in a component's template.</p>
<p>  We kicked off early prototyping of selectorless and we're still in early stages of planning. We'll share a request for comments when we have a design and we're ready for next steps.</p>

        <p>To enable developers to handle asynchronous data flow with signals we developed the <code>resource</code> async primitive. Building on top of it, we introduced <code>httpResource</code> which allows you to send HTTP requests and receive your response as a signal.</p>
<p>  We're still actively collecting feedback for these new experimental APIs. Please give them a try and share your feedback with us on GitHub!</p>

      <h3>Zoneless Angular</h3>
      <p>In v18 we shipped experimental zoneless support in Angular. It enables developers to use the framework without including zone.js in their bundle, which improves performance, debugging experience, and interoperability. As part of the initial release we also introduced zoneless support to the Angular CDK and Angular Material.</p>
<p>  In v19 we introduced zoneless support in server-side rendering, addressed some edge cases, and created a schematic to scaffold zoneless projects. We transitioned <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> to zoneless which improved performance, developer experience, and allowed us to identify gaps that we need to address before moving this feature to developer preview.</p>
<p>  As of Angular v20.2, Zoneless Angular is now stable and includes improvements in error handling and server-side rendering.</p>

<p>  In Angular v19 we shipped developer preview of route-level render mode which allows you to granularly configure which routes you want Angular to prerender, server-side render or client-side render. In Angular v20 we graduated it to stable.</p>

<p>  In v19 we shipped the incremental hydration in developer preview mode, powered by <code>@defer</code> blocks. In Angular v20 we graduated it to stable!</p>

        <p>This project rethinks the Angular reactivity model by introducing Signals as a reactivity primitive. The initial planning resulted in hundreds of discussions, conversations with developers, feedback sessions, user experience studies, and a series of RFCs, which received over 1,000 comments.</p>
<p>  In Angular v20 we graduated all the fundamental reactivity primitives to stable including signal, effect, linkedSignal, signal-based queries, and inputs.</p>
